# I wanted my seniors to have a hard time, so I wrote code in Ruby.

# Define a constant for the size of the array
SIZE = 10

# Define a compare method to be used for sorting the array in descending order.
# This method takes two arguments, a and b, and compares them using the spaceship operator.
# It returns 1 if a < b, 0 if a == b, and -1 if a > b, which is reversed for descending order.
def compare(a, b)
  b <=> a
end

# Read an integer from standard input and assign it to num.
# This represents the number of times the loop will execute, each time processing a new array of integers.
num = gets.to_i

# Execute the block num times.
# Each iteration represents a new set of SIZE integers to be processed.
num.times do
  # Initialize an array with SIZE elements.
  array = Array.new(SIZE)

  # Fill the array with integers read from standard input.
  # Loop SIZE times, reading an integer each time and assigning it to the current position in the array.
  (0...SIZE).each do |j|
    array[j] = gets.to_i
  end

  # Sort the array in descending order.
  # The sort! method is used to sort the array in place, altering the original array.
  # The custom compare method is passed as a block to define the sorting behavior (descending order).
  array.sort! { |a, b| compare(a, b) }

  # Output the third largest number in the array.
  # Since the array is sorted in descending order, the third element (index 2) is the third largest.
  puts array[2]
end

# 요즘 루비로 코드를 공부하고 있었는데, 선배들이 코드를 리뷰해준다는 소식을 듣고 Ruby로 코드를 작성하였습니다 !
# 화이팅 !!
