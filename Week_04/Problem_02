# I wanted my seniors to have a hard time, so I wrote code in Ruby.

# Reads a line from the input and removes the trailing newline character. 
# `gets.chomp` reads a string input from the user, and `chomp` removes the newline character at the end.
arr = gets.chomp

# Initializes `count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of words found in the input string.
count = 0

# If the first character of the input string is not a space, increment `count` by 1.
# This is because the presence of a non-space character at the beginning signifies the start of a word.
count = 1 if arr[0] != ' '

# Iterates through the characters of the input string starting from the second character (index 1) up to the last character.
# The range `(1...arr.length)` ensures we start checking from the second character and go through to the end of the string.
(1...arr.length).each do |i|
  # Increments `count` by 1 if the current character is not a space and the previous character is a space.
  # This condition checks for the start of a new word, assuming words are separated by spaces.
  # It specifically looks for a pattern where a word starts immediately after a space, indicating a new word.
  count += 1 if arr[i - 1] == ' ' && arr[i] != ' '
end

# Outputs the total count of words found in the input string.
# This is the final result, showing how many words were counted based on the space separation.
puts count

# 요즘 루비로 코드를 공부하고 있었는데, 선배들이 코드를 리뷰해준다는 소식을 듣고 Ruby로 코드를 작성하였습니다 !
# 화이팅 !!
