# I wanted my seniors to have a hard time, so I wrote code in Ruby.

# Read the number of coin types and the target amount in one line
coin_types, target_amount = gets.split.map(&:to_i)
# Read the values of the coins
coin_values = Array.new(coin_types) { gets.to_i }

# Initialize the DP array: all values are set to 0, with a length of target_amount+1
# dp[i] stores the number of ways to make the amount i
dp = Array.new(target_amount + 1, 0)
# There is 1 way to make 0 amount, which is using no coins
dp[0] = 1

# Iterate over each coin
coin_values.each do |coin|
  # For each amount from the value of the current coin to the target amount
  (coin..target_amount).each do |amount|
    # If it's possible to make the current amount using the current coin,
    # add the number of ways to make (current amount - coin value) to the current amount's ways
    dp[amount] += dp[amount - coin]
  end
end

# Output the number of ways to make the target amount
puts dp[target_amount]

# Review
# 요즘 루비로 코드를 공부하고 있었는데, 선배들이 코드를 리뷰해준다는 소식을 듣고 Ruby로 코드를 작성하였습니다 !
# 화이팅 !!
