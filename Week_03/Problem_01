# I wanted my seniors to have a hard time, so I wrote code in Ruby.

# Reads an integer from standard input and assigns it to the variable 'number'.
number = gets.to_i

# Initializes a 2-dimensional array (matrix) of integers. The outer array has 'number' of elements (rows).
# Each row is created by reading a line from standard input, splitting it into an array of strings based on spaces,
# and then converting each string in the array into an integer. This process repeats 'number' times to fill the matrix.
matrix = Array.new(number) { gets.split.map(&:to_i) }

# Flattens the 2-dimensional matrix into a 1-dimensional array and sorts it in descending order.
# 'flatten' converts the 2-dimensional array into a 1-dimensional array by merging all inner arrays.
# 'sort' then arranges the elements of this array in ascending order, and 'reverse' changes that order to descending.
sorted_numbers = matrix.flatten.sort.reverse

# Outputs the element at the position 'number - 1' in the sorted array. Since the array is 0-indexed,
# this operation effectively prints the Nth largest number in the matrix, where N is the value of 'number'.
puts sorted_numbers[number-1]
